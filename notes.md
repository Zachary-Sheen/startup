## AWS Notes

For this, AWS wasn't terrible setting up, it was just assigning an elastic IP that took me a while because I had to make sure I was in the right region.  Once I got that done, everything else was easy.  Assigning a Route 53 domain name was pretty easy and assigning the IP address to connect and launch was pretty easy. 

## HTML Notes

For this, part of the assignment was creating a page using html in Codepen which you can find [here](https://codepen.io/Sheenster/pen/qEWMwjw).  I learned about a lot of the fundamental objects in HTML such as div, main, header, body, anchors, etc.  This was a really great way for me to start off the website.  Also, I learned a lot about the fundamentals of the input fields like select, radio, optgroups, input boxes, etc.  I tested them in Codepen and this [link](https://codepen.io/Sheenster/pen/raBZbRP) has all the types that I would ever need to use.
