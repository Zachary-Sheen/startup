## AWS Notes

For this, AWS wasn't terrible setting up, it was just assigning an elastic IP that took me a while because I had to make sure I was in the right region.  Once I got that done, everything else was easy.  Assigning a Route 53 domain name was pretty easy and assigning the IP address to connect and launch was pretty easy. 

## HTML Notes

For this, part of the assignment was creating a page using html in Codepen which you can find [here](https://codepen.io/Sheenster/pen/qEWMwjw).  I learned about a lot of the fundamental objects in HTML such as div, main, header, body, anchors, etc.  This was a really great way for me to start off the website.  Also, I learned a lot about the fundamentals of the input fields like select, radio, optgroups, input boxes, etc.  I tested them in Codepen and this [link](https://codepen.io/Sheenster/pen/raBZbRP) has all the types that I would ever need to use.  For the last part of learning the different types of HTML elements, I made a [page](https://codepen.io/Sheenster/pen/vEBzMoX) where you can listen to audio, watch a video, and has drawn images on a canvas and SVG.  

## CSS Notes
For this part of the assignment I created a page using just CSS in Codepen that you can find [here](https://codepen.io/Sheenster/pen/ogvaVxe).  Also, I leanred a lot about how using flexbox makes styling in CSS a lot easier than it used to be.  You can see how I use it in this [Codepen](https://codepen.io/Sheenster/pen/dPbrpYR).  I learned how to use Bootstrap and how it can help a lot in formatting and making a page look cool.  You can find the link for that [here](https://codepen.io/Sheenster/pen/RNbdGjJ).

## React P1 Notes
For this part I learned how Javascript and react work, and I used this [Codepen](https://codepen.io/Sheenster/pen/qEWMwjw) to see how arrays work in JavaScript.
