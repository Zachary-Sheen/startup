## AWS Notes
Ss
For this, AWS wasn't terrible setting up, it was just assigning an elastic IP that took me a while because I had to make sure I was in the right region.  Once I got that done, everything else was easy.  Assigning a Route 53 domain name was pretty easy and assigning the IP address to connect and launch was pretty easy. 

## HTML Notes

For this, part of the assignment was creating a page using html in Codepen which you can find [here](https://codepen.io/Sheenster/pen/qEWMwjw).  I learned about a lot of the fundamental objects in HTML such as div, main, header, body, anchors, etc.  This was a really great way for me to start off the website.  Also, I learned a lot about the fundamentals of the input fields like select, radio, optgroups, input boxes, etc.  I tested them in Codepen and this [link](https://codepen.io/Sheenster/pen/raBZbRP) has all the types that I would ever need to use.  For the last part of learning the different types of HTML elements, I made a [page](https://codepen.io/Sheenster/pen/vEBzMoX) where you can listen to audio, watch a video, and has drawn images on a canvas and SVG.  

## CSS Notes
For this part of the assignment I created a page using just CSS in Codepen that you can find [here](https://codepen.io/Sheenster/pen/ogvaVxe).  Also, I leanred a lot about how using flexbox makes styling in CSS a lot easier than it used to be.  You can see how I use it in this [Codepen](https://codepen.io/Sheenster/pen/dPbrpYR).  I learned how to use Bootstrap and how it can help a lot in formatting and making a page look cool.  You can find the link for that [here](https://codepen.io/Sheenster/pen/RNbdGjJ).

## React P1 Notes
For this part I learned how React works and how I can use it to manipulate the HTML of my website, which I demonstrate [here](https://codepen.io/Sheenster/pen/KwPYBwq).  I figured out how do to routing within React, which you can see [here](https://codepen.io/Sheenster/pen/emOojVP).

## React P2 Notes
For this part I learned how Javascript and React work, and I used this [Codepen](https://codepen.io/Sheenster/pen/qEWMwjw) to see how arrays work in JavaScript.  I also learned a lot about promises and how I can use them to better run my code to get information back to the user quickly, [here](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/RwJJKwj) is the code for that.  I learned how to use async and await to help with running processes in the background.  The code I used to learn that is [here](https://codepen.io/Sheenster/pen/mydErjM).  Also, I learned how useState works in being able to take user input and automatically change data.  I used the code [here](https://codepen.io/Sheenster/pen/Eaxygda) to learn it.

## Service Deliverable Notes
For this part I learned how to setup a service using NodeJS and express and implemented mutliple service endpoints to make my app work while being able to securely contain information in my backend.  I learned a lot about different endpoints such as get, post, put, and delete, which I used in my application to make the service available to the front end.  I also learned how to configure vite to allow me to debug the service in my development environment.

## Database Deliverable
For this part I learned how to setup a MongoDB database and then connect to it locally so I can store different types of information in it.  Also, I learned how to filter the database to gather different types of information that I parse in my back end.  Setting the database up and switching the endpoints over to call MongoDB was somewhat easy and very useful.

## WebSocket Deliverable
For this part of the startup I learned how to set up a user-to-user chat.  First, I learned basic WebSocket communication by testing within the browser and debugging local code to see each part of the communication.  I learned how to connect, send, and recieve messages in WebSocket.  I also learned how to make models for WebSocket where I can make communication simpler by defining what the message being passed through is for.  I learned how to make the functions that recieve and send messages in WebSocket and how to alter them to be useful for my website.  For example, when to update the database for a certain message was a great thing to implement.
