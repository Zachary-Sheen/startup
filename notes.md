## AWS Notes

For this, AWS wasn't terrible setting up, it was just assigning an elastic IP that took me a while because I had to make sure I was in the right region.  Once I got that done, everything else was easy.  Assigning a Route 53 domain name was pretty easy and assigning the IP address to connect and launch was pretty easy.
